# FCC Recipe Box

#### - Project description:

+ Recipe Box is a Project made for [ FreeCodeCamp's]("https://www.freecodecamp.org/") Data Visualization Certification using React and React-Bootstrap. You can add, edit and delete recipes. The recipes are stored in the browser's local storage so you can restart the browser and they won't disappear. Also, if you clear the local storage, the Recipe Box will get repopulated with the original recipes, to make sure you have ideas for your next meal.
